# GISAirportLookupProject
This GIS based application displays the top ten largest airports in the US. This application will use the hot link tool (lightning bolt cursor) to display more information about the airport. When clicked on the airport location, a dialog window will display information such as airport code, type of airport, geographical coordinates, elevation, number of terminals, hub for major airline, passenger handling capacity, cargo handling capacity, year of construction, distance from city downtown, links to official airport website and also links to Wikipedia which provides more facts about the airport. The picture of an aerial view of the airport is displayed in the dialog box. The dialog also includes additional information for passenger commute like availability of rental car service and airport shuttle service. It includes their contact details and links to their websites. If the airport is not located in the capital city of the state, it will display the distance of the airport from the capital city. If the airport has a helipad facility it will be displayed in the dialog.
